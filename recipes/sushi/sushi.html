        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, what's sushi? <em>Sushi</em> is any dish that consists of <strong>vinegared rice</strong> 
            (we call it “Sushi Rice“) combined with other ingredients such as <strong>seafood</strong> and <strong>
            vegetables</strong>. Some people think sushi means raw fish, but that's not entirely true. 
            There are various types of sushi, and you can find variations here.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the sushi rice is wrapped in nori seaweed and rolled, it is a sushi roll. In Japan, we call it 
            Makizushi or Maki Sushi.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sushi Rice</li>
            <li>Assortment of raw fish</li>
            <li>Assortment of vegetables</li>
            <li>Roasted Seaweed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. Please cook the rice ahead of time following my Sushi Rice recipe. 
                The cook time varies depending on the device/method you use.</li>
            <li>Cut both ends of 1 Japanese or Persian cucumber. Cut in half lengthwise, then cut the halves 
                again lengthwise so you now have 4 strips.</li>
            <li>Cut the 7 oz sashimi-grade tuna block lengthwise.</li>
            <li>Cut 5 sheets nori (dried laver seaweed) in half. Even though it may look it, nori sheets are 
                not perfectly square; therefore, cut the longer side of the rectangle in half. </li>
            <li>Spread the rice evenly with both fingers, still keeping the 1-inch space on the top. Wet your 
                fingers in dipping water if the rice starts to stick.</li>
        </ol>
