        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This may come as a surprise, but <em>Japanese Curry</em>, aka Curry Rice is an exemplary comfort food and one 
            of the most-loved home-cooked dishes in Japan. I grew up on curry rice, as my mom would make it as 
            frequently as I can recall.

            The bite-sized chunks of meat, the thick-cut vegetables, the rich and creamy brown curry sauce, and the 
            fluffy rice make every bite so comforting and exciting. Not only is it a meal that's easy to make on busy 
            nights, but it also tastes better on the second day.

            Japanese curry is a thick curry with a stew-like consistency and commonly includes protein, sweet onions, 
            carrots, and potatoes. The sauce is thickened by a roux (a mixture of fat and flour and an addition of 
            curry spices).

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. Please read my blog post on the “secret ingredient” we add to the curry. 
                For this recipe, I add ginger, garlic, apple, honey, soy sauce, and ketchup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut 2 onions into wedges. I like to have the texture of the onions in my curry, so I cut them into 
                thick wedges. If you prefer, you can mince or thinly slice the onions so they disintegrate into the sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel 2 carrots and cut them into rolling wedges (it's called rangiri in Japanese). This type of cut 
                creates more surface area, which helps the carrots absorb more flavor and cook faster.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 4 cups chicken stock/broth. To reduce the sodium, you can substitute with water only or use half 
                stock and half water, if you prefer. Tip: If you're using my homemade curry roux, you don't need to
                 worry as it does not contain salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve the curry with steamed Japanese short-grain rice on the side. If you like, garnish with
                 fukujinzuke (Japanese red pickled vegetables).
